# TeamScape User Guide

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is a **desktop app for managing contacts and the tasks under it, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TeamScape can get your contact/task management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Adopted from AB3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com tele/@john pos/student a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Finding persons by name:

Format: `find n/ KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find n/ john` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find n/ alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find n/ bernice alex'](images/findAlexBerniceResult.png)

Finding persons by tags:

Format: `find t/ KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

  ![result for 'find t/ colleagues friend'](images/findColleaguesFriendResult.png)

Finding persons by tasks:

Finding persons by multiple conditions (limited to name, tags and tasks):

Format: `find n/ KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] t/ KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] task/ KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

This finds all persons who meets all the conditions in the specified name, tags, and task fields.

Intuitively, you can think about this as an 'AND' operation. For example, if you want to find all interns that are assigned with the barbeque task, you can use the example command shown below.

Example Usage:
* `find t/ intern task/ bbq` returns all Persons with tags interns AND task descriptions containing the word 'bbq'.
  ![result for 'find t/ intern task/ bbq'](images/findInternBBQResult.png)


### Generate Task Status Report : `report`

![generate report for one task](images/report3.png)


### Deleting a person : `delete`

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find n/ Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.


### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`


### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`


### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
